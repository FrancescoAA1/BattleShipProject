// To perform its movement and repair action, the support ship needs the following data:
// The target position of the movement, which is also the center of the repair area.
// Even though the ship does not require attack units provided by others to perform its action,
// an (empty) array is still passed in order to make the action methods of all ships consistent.
//
// The checks on the validity of the move have already been performed, 
// and the ship can therefore safely proceed with the action.
// A boolean value is still returned to confirm that the move was executed.
