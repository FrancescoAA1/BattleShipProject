// To perform its attack action, the Ironclad ship requires the following data:
// The attack map of the player issuing the move, which will be modified
// The target position of the attack
// The new AttackUnit to replace in the received attack map at the target position
// Although only one AttackUnit is received, an array is used to conform to the action methods of all ships
//
// Validity checks for the move have already been performed, so the ship can safely execute the action
// Returns a boolean confirming whether the action was performed
